# JomOS Settings

Documentation for configuration tweaks of JomOS

## /etc/sysctl.d/99-JomOS-settings.conf

### vm.swappiness

The swappiness sysctl parameter represents the kernel's preference (or avoidance) of swap space. Swappiness can have a value between 0 and 100, the default value is 60.

A low value causes the kernel to avoid swapping, a higher value causes the kernel to try to use swap space. Using a low value on sufficient memory is known to improve responsiveness on many systems.

This value is automatically calculated using your ram amount

### vm.vfs_cache_pressure

The value controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the memory which is used for caching of directory and inode objects (VFS cache).

Lowering it from the default value of 100 makes the kernel less inclined to reclaim VFS cache (do not set it to 0, this may produce out-of-memory conditions)

This value is automatically calculated using your ram amount

### vm.page-cluster

refer to <https://xeome.github.io/notes/Zram#page-cluster-values-latency-difference>

### vm.dirty_ratio

Contains, as a percentage of total available memory that contains free pages and reclaimable pages, the number of pages at which a process which is generating disk writes will itself start writing out dirty data (Default is 20).

### vm.dirty_background_ratio

Contains, as a percentage of total available memory that contains free pages and reclaimable pages, the number of pages at which the background kernel flusher threads will start writing out dirty data (Default is 10).

### Network tweaks

The BBR congestion control algorithm can help achieve higher bandwidths and lower latencies for internet traffic

TCP Fast Open is an extension to the transmission control protocol (TCP) that helps reduce network latency by enabling data to be exchanged during the sender’s initial TCP SYN. Using the value 3 instead of the default 1 allows TCP Fast Open for both incoming and outgoing connections

### kernel.nmi_watchdog

Disabling NMI watchdog will speed up your boot and shutdown, because one less module is loaded. Additionally disabling watchdog timers increases performance and lowers power consumption

## /etc/udev/rules.d/ioscheduler.rules

The kernel component that determines the order in which block I/O operations are submitted to storage devices is the input/output (I/O) scheduler.The goal of the I/O scheduler is to optimize how these can deal with read requests, it is useful to review some specifications of the two main drive types:

- An HDD has spinning disks and a physical head that moves to the required location. As a result, random latency is quite high, ranging between 3 and 12ms (depending on whether it is a high-end server drive or a laptop drive bypassing the disk controller write buffer), whereas sequential access provides significantly higher throughput. The average HDD throughput is approximately 200 I/O operations per second (IOPS).

- An SSD does not have moving parts, random access is as fast as sequential one, typically under 0.1ms, and it can handle multiple concurrent requests. The typical SSD throughput is greater than 10,000 IOPS, which is more than needed in common workload situations.

Thousands of IOPS can be generated if multiple processes make I/O requests to different storage parts, whereas a typical HDD can only handle about 200 IOPS. There is a queue of requests that must wait for storage access. This is where I/O schedulers can help with optimization.

The best scheduler to use is determined by both the device and the specific nature of the workload. Furthermore, throughput in MB/s is not the only measure of performance: deadlines or fairness reduce overall throughput while improving system responsiveness.

```ini
# set scheduler for NVMe
ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="nvme[0-9]n[0-9]", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="none"
# set scheduler for SSD and eMMC
ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]*|mmcblk[0-9]*", ATTR{queue/rotational}=="0", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="mq-deadline"
# set scheduler for rotating disks
ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]*", ATTR{queue/rotational}=="1", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="bfq"
```

For example the [udev](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Udev "Udev") rule above sets the scheduler to _none_ for [NVMe](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVMe "NVMe"), _mq-deadline_ for [SSD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSD "SSD")/eMMC, and _bfq_ for rotational drives:
